-Google Compute Engine virtual machine instances and other resources
-Google Cloud SQL instances
-Google Kubernetes Engine clusters
-Google Cloud Dataproc clusters and jobs
-Google Cloud DNS managed zones and record sets

SHOULD I USE JAVASCRIPT OR JAVA FOR MY NEXT PROJECT?
As with all languages, the choice really boils down to what you’re trying to build and what resources you have at your disposal. JavaScript is still very much a web technology, whereas Java is a general purpose language that can build anything.

#You should consider Java if your project involves…

-Android Apps
-Enterprise Software
-Scientific Computing
-Big Data Analytics
-General Purpose Programming of Hardware
-Server-Side Technologies like Apache, JBoss, Geronimo, GlassFish, etc.

#You should consider JavaScript if your project involves…

-Dynamic single page applications (SPAs)
-Front-End technologies like jQuery, AngularJS, Backbone.js, Ember.js, ReactJS etc.
-Server-Side technologies like Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, etc.
-Mobile App Development through PhoneGap, React Native, etc.
